// Since functions are first-class citizens in JS, they can be assigned to variables, passed as argument into functions, and returned by other functions. So, it is important to type the variables, parameters, or return values that are expected to have a function value.
// While we can use the "function" keyword as a type, it doesn't specify the types of the function's parameters and return value, or its async or sync nature. So, to specify the exact type (structure of the function), TS provides an arrow-function-like syntax for defining the type. Ex: const someFunction: (param1: type1, param2: type2) => returnType = function (...) {...}
// We learned that the "void" type explicitly specified in niche situations. Writing the function type is one of such situations where the return type has to be specified. Ex: (x: number, y: number) => void
